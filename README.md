The usage of Flexbox is to arrange the items in one dimension and it can be row or column. In Portfolio, the Flexbox holds the items for activities so the user can manage the items with ease.
The nav also helps make the design of this portfolio responsive. When the user clicks the section they want to open, the nav will react and take the user to the desired section.
For example, when I click 'Activities' in the nav, it will react and take me to the activities section, which is the flexbox section.
